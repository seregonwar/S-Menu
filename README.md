A mod menu base for Grand Theft Auto V.
Strictly for educational purposes.

S-Menu is originally based of off [BigBaseV2](https://github.com/Pocakking/BigBaseV2) which was an amazing base at the time but nowadays is a bit dated.
So here I am with an up-to-date menu focusing on protecting the user from toxic modders.
